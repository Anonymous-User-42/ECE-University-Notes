\subsection{{Description}}

	{An 8-bit register utilizing D flip-flops serves as a digital storage unit, where each flip-flop corresponds to a single bit of data.} 
	
	{The register is structured with eight D flip-flops arranged in a cascading fashion, forming a sequential chain from the least significant bit (LSB) to the most significant bit (MSB).} 
	
	{The presence of the reset input allows for the complete clearing of the register, initializing all flip-flops to a predetermined state, commonly zero ("00000000" in this circuit design).} 
	
	{Synchronization is achieved through a clock signal, ensuring precise data capture at specified clock edges and mitigating signal propagation delays.} 
	
	{This 8-bit register plays a vital role in our digital logic circuit, as its output is an direct input to the arithmetic logic unit (ALU).}

\subsection{{Truth Table}}

	{An 8-bit register would ideally have 256 possible state values for some arbitary string of inputs "A" \& "B".}
	
	{Our choice of "A" \& "B" are the last 4 digits of my student number (50120\textbf{9136}) in hexadecimal converted to binary.}
	
	{$$\therefore A = (91)_{16} = (10010001)_{2}$$}
	
	{$$\therefore B = (36)_{16} = (00110110)_{2}$$}

	{The pair of inputs under consideration represent two among the 256 potential combinations achievable through an 8-bit D-flip-flop employed for input processing.}
	
	{In practice, when input A is applied, the D-flip-flop captures and retains the corresponding value until it is transmitted to the output during the subsequent rising edge. Notably, alterations to the output state exclusively occur on a rising edge, contingent upon the presence of a novel input.}
	
	{In the absence of a distinct input, the output remains unchanged unless a reset condition is invoked. This operational behavior underscores the discrete and controlled nature of input-output transformations within the described system.}

\subsection{{Block Diagram}}

	{To accommodate the requisite pair of 8-bit inputs, distinct registers are employed for the representation of values denoted as A and B. The application of the code prescribed in the laboratory guidelines yields illustrative block diagrams, as depicted in figure \ref{Latch}.}
	
	{Within this context, the inputs consist of "A," "Clock," and "Reset," collectively constituting the triad of input variables, while the resultant output ($O(B, Clock, Reset)$ from the \textbf{truth table}) is represented by "Q".}
