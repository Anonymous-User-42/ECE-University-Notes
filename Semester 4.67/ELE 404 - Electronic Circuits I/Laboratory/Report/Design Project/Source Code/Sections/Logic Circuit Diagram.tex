{The circuit is composed of three 2N3904 Bipolar Junction Transistors (BJTs), labeled as \( Q_1 \), \( Q_2 \), and \( Q_3 \), along with fourteen resistors and six electrolytic capacitors. The power supply \( V_{CC} \) provides a 10 V source, which is modulated by the sinusoidal signal source \( V_s \).}
