{The small-signal behaviour of diodes is pivotal in electronic applications, particularly in signal processing and amplification circuits. This experiment aims to analyse the small-signal behaviour of a 1N4148 diode by measuring its AC resistance at different quiescent current values.}

{We shall then investigate the small-signal behaviour of a 1N4148 diode by measuring its AC resistance at different quiescent current values using a circuit setup depicted in Figure 2(a) and incorporating resistors, including a shunt resistor.}

{Through systematic experimentation and measurement recording, the aim of this experiment is to analyse the relationship between diode voltage and current variations, providing insights into dynamic diode characteristics for electronic circuit design optimisation.}
