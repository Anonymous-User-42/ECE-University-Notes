{We shall, in the due process of the laboratory experiment, aim to demonstrate the validity of the fundamental principle of the conservation of momentum, which states that the sum of the initial momenta before any work done by internal energies is equal to the sum of momenta after work done by internal energies.}

{We aim to validate this experiment's principle of conservation of momentum by investigating and analyzing the effects of two carts following an elastic collision and an inelastic collision.}
