\textit{We shall be modeling the \textbf{viscous drag} with respect to time for all cases with the \textbf{aid of the simulation program} with the initial utility of equations \ref{eq3} and \ref{eq4}, shall be called derived data, as it is derived from the values of \textbf{radial} and \textbf{angular displacement} versus \textbf{time}, and this is not the primary focus of this investigation.}

\textit{All data necessary relating to this chapter of the investigation can be found in \textbf{appendix \ref{dvdata}}}
