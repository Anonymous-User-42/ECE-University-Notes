\textit{The \textbf{system of the damped elastic pendula} would act very similar to the the \textbf{dynamics of the damped simple pendulum}, and that the damping that would take place would be \textbf{nearly equal} to the damped simple pendulum, which means that the \textbf{motion should be approximately similar to the simple pendulum in all degrees of freedom}.}
