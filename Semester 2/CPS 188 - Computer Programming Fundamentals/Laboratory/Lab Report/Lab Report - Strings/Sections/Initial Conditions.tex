\textit{We define certain \textbf{initial conditions} for this dynamic system and convert this system to an \textbf{initial value problem} (IVP) system.}
        
    $$x(0) = 0$$
        
    \textit{Where $x(0)$ is the initial extension length of the spring at time t = 0}
        
    $$\theta(0) = \pi/2$$
        
    \textit{Where $\theta(0)$ is the initial angular displacement of the system at time t = 0}
