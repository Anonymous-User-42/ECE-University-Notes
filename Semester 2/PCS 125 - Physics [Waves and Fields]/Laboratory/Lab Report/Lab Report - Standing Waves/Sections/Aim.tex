\textit{To \textbf{collect experimental raw data} relating to the variation in \textbf{radial displacement}, the variation in \textbf{angular displacement}, the variation in \textbf{angular frequency} and the variation in \textbf{absolute frequency} in a lab controlled setting of a \textbf{damped elastic harmonic oscillator} and to compare it with \textbf{computer simulations} of the same and hence study its \textbf{different states} and calculate the value the of \textbf{inconsistencies} in the \textbf{accuracy} of the \textbf{mathematically modeled computer simulation} to that of the \textbf{actual experiment} and vice-versa.}
