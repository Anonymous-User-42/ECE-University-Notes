{In this lab, we got some hands-on experience with the physics behind sound waves and beats.}

{In this lab we will use the basics of traveling waves, and interference to understand the behavior of sound waves and how they work. In the experiment we examined beats, with similar frequencies but not exactly the same so we can understand interference of beats and how they relate to us in the real world.}

{To complete this experiment successfully we used various instruments such as speakers, microphone and tuning forks, to help generate and measure sound waves.}

{We also had to use a computer software which helps us interpret our data and allows us to plot graphs and get a better understanding of the experiment. Overall this lab is able to give us a good understanding of the physics behind waves and beats.}
