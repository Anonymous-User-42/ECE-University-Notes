{A lot was learned after completing this lab about sound waves and beats including their characteristics. By finding the frequencies of waves it makes it possible for us to learn many things about them. Some formulas that we used and the physics behind them is:}

	$$\Delta P = \Delta P_{max}\sin\left(kx - \omega t + \phi\right)$$

{This is the equation for a wave, where $\Delta P$ is the change in pressure, $\Delta P_{max}$ is the maximum pressure, \textit{k} is the wave number, \textit{x} is the position, $\omega$ is the angular frequency, \textit{t} is the time, and $\phi$ is the phase constant.}

{This formula is important because it allows us to calculate the beat frequency. This is the frequency at which the amplitude of the resultant wave oscillates due to interference between two waves of slightly different frequencies.}

{To calculate the fast and slow frequencies we can use the two formulas listed below.}

	$$P_{1}\left(t\right) = A\cos\left(2\pi f_{1}t\right)$$
	
	$$P_{2}\left(t\right) = A\cos\left(2\pi f_{21}t\right)$$
	
{By using these two cosine trigonometric identities, we can easily determine the equations for $f_{fast}$ and for $f_{slow}$.}

	$$f_{fast} = \frac{1}{2}\left(f_{1} + f_{2}\right)$$
	
	$$f_{slow} = \frac{1}{2}\left|f_{2} - f_{1}\right|$$
