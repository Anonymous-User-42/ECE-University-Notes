{This experiment can be said to be a success.Although there were a number of inaccuracies, we were able to achieve all the goals of the experiment and further understand wave interference.}

{By experimenting with both constructive and destructive interference. We determined that the most effective way of finding the frequency of a wave is finding the inverse of its period.}

{The principle of wave interference also has a lot of applications when it comes to the real world, affecting the sounds and music we hear.}

{Take for example two violins playing in an orchestra, the instruments have to be tuned in order to produce the same wave assuming the two violinists are playing in sync, this allows constructive interference, increasing the amplitude of the note being played.}

{This can be seen with destructive interference in noise canceling headphones, which work by matching the waveform of the ambient sound and playing that wave completely out of sync with the ambient sound.}
