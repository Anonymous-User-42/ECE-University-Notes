\textit{There are various limitations in this study/investigation as we have placed forth, certain strict initial conditions and other conditions that make this system so constrained and disables us to expand our researching capability of this chaotic phenomenon. Conditions such as,}
        
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Restricting the value of $\theta(0)$ to $\pi/2$}
        \item \textit{Restricting the value of $x(0)$ to $0$}
        \item \textit{Restricting the value of $l_0$ to 1 m}
        \item \textit{Restricting the value of the time domain from 0 to 20 seconds}
        \item \textit{Restricting the value of the radius of the mass employed to $5\times10^{-2}$ m}
        \item \textit{Restricting the value of the spring stiffness constant to 100 N/m}
