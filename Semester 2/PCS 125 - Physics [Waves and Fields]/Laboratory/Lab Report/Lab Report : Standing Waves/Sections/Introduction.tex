{This lab experiment demonstrates the different frequencies and amplitudes that will create a pattern of a sinusoidal wave with different “standing waves”.  A “standing wave’ has nodes where there are points on the wave that do not move.}

{The lab is completed by vibrating a string with a sinusoidal oscillator  where the frequency and amplitude is calibrated using a function generator. Different masses will be used to work with different tensions that affect the speed of the waves.}
