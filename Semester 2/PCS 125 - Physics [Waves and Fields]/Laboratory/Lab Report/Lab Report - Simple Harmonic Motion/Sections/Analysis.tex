%	{In this particular lab experiment, the component of physics known as circular motion was introduced. This area of physics analyzes the fundamental behavior and laws that an object adhere's to when the object moves around a circular path. An important part of this is circular acceleration, or as itâ€™s known as centripetal acceleration. Therfore we have,}
