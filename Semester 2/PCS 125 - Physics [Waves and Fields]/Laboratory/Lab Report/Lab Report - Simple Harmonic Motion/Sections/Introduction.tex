{The main objective of this lab is to study and examine the properties of simple harmonic waves. This will be done by graphing the position of the hanging mass vs time.}

{The resulting graphs shall be analyzed by using the LoggerPro software and by using Hooke's law to analyze the spring-mass systems vertical strech, amplitude and period of oscillation.}
