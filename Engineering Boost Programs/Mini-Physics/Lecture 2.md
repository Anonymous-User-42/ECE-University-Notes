*   The science of measurement is known as **metrology**
*   Measurements generally have some uncertainities to them

Example:    Speed of Sound in Air at STP (Standard Temperature and Pressure) :- 1439.07 +- 0.05 m/s

#   Significant Figures

##  Rules

*   All non-zero digits are considered "significant". ie. 123456
*   All zeros that occur between any two non-zero digits are "significant". ie. 111.0077
*   All zeros that are on the right of a decimal point and also to the left of a non-zero digit are never significant. ie. 0.00885
*   All zeros that are on the right of a decimal point are significant, only if, a non-zero digit does proceed them. ie. 200.0055
*   All the zeros that are on the right of the last non-zero digit, after the decimal point, are significant. ie. 0.20000

Note:   It is easier from our "rules" to disceren significant figures from decimal values. For this reason, it is always recommended to represent values in **Scientific Notation**

##  Addition / Subraction

When adding or subracting values, the result cannot have any more significant figures to the right of the decimal point than the value with the fewest significant digits to the right of the decimal point.

Example:    452.**12** + 34.**4412** - 191.**5** = 295.**1**

##  Multiplication / Division



##  Square Roots

The square root of a value with "n" signoficant digits has "n + 1" significant digits.

Example:    sqrt(100.6) = 10.030

##  Logarithms

When taking a logarithm of a value with "n" significant figures, the result must contain "n" significant figures in the **mantissa** of the result (the decimal portion).

#   Vectors

*   Any quantity that has a magnitude (size) and direction

Examples include:

*   Displacemet
*   Velocity
*   Acceleration
*   Force
*   Momentum
*   Most Fields

Note:   Velocity as an example, Speed is the magnitude of our vector. Velocity = Speed + it's direction

##  Representation

Vectors are represented using both the initial point and the final point of a vector.

Example: Vector from A to B can be represented as **AB** or AB with a arrow above it.

##  Operations

### Addition / Subraction

**A** + **B** = **C**
Also, **A** + **B** = **B** + **A**

**A** + (-**B**) = **C**

Note:   "Minus sign" means opposite direction with the same magnitude

### Multiplication / Division by a Scalar

When multiplied or divided by a scalar (constant), the vector increases or decreases (subsequently) in magnitude only.

Note:   Direction does not change.

### Rectanglular Coordinate System

#   Scalars

*   Any quantity that has only magnitude (size)

Examples include:

*   Distance
*   Time
*   Energy
*   Mass
*   Volume
*   Density

##  Representation

Scalars are represented using both the initial point and the final point just like a vector, instead we additionally encase it in straight line parantheses ( (||XX||), like an absolute value symbol). A short hand for scalars is to write it as the absolute value of the vector from those exact same points.

Example: Scalar from A to B can be represented as ||AB|| or |AB| as a shorthand.
