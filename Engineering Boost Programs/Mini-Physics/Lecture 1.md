#   Types of Models in Physics

*   Geometric Models
*   Simplification Models
*   Analysis Models
*   Structural Models

##  Geometric Models

We set up a **geopetric construct** that represents the real-world situation, but which removes the complexity. We can then use this model to solve the problem.

Example:    Determine the Circumference of a Pizza (Not a perfect circle, But we assume that it is a perfect circle, averaging the radius)

##  Simplification Models

*   Simplification Models are very important in Physics.
*   Simplification Models remove details from the system that have no impact on the outcome of the problem.

Examples include:

*   Rigid Objects
*   Frictionless surfaces (or surfaces with constant friction)
*   Massless Springs
*   

### Rigid Bodies

A body whose deformation is zero or so small it can be neglected when considering systems.

### The Particle Model

Particle Models where additional information or parameters are not relavent as they are constant (do not change in the system) and are assumed as point particle models. Such parameters are ignored as they do not affect the model in study.

### Analysis Model

*   An Analysis Model is one whereby a new problem is solved using a general problem-solving methodology that has been shown to work before and which can be applied to a new problem.
*   Learning about these models is a key reason students should be attending lectures and tutorials.

Examples include:

*   Structural Models
*   
*   
*   

####    Structural Models

Used for systems that are often too small for us to observe and interact with directly.

*   Cosmological Scales - Example: Solar System
*   Atomic Scales - Example: Hydrogen Atom

#   Alternate Representations

*   Alternative representations are directly related to modelling.
*   A representation is a method of viewing and/or presenting information related to a given problem
*   This becomes quite important in the process of problem solving
*   There are generally 6 alternate representations

    -   Mental Representation
    -   Pictorial Representations
    -   Simplified Pictorial Representations
    -   Graphical Representations
    -   Tabular Representations
    -   Mathematical Represenations

#   Dimensions, Units and Significant Figures

##  Dimensions

Physics is intrested in the measurement if **real-world** quantities (not pure numbers as in mathematics). Some quantities are fundamentally different than othere (they are measured differently) because they have different dimensions.

Dimension - [] means "dimension of"

Examples include:

*   [Length] = L
*   [Mass] = M
*   [Time] = T
*   [Current] = I
*   [Luminous Intensity] = J
*   [Temperature] = Q

##  Units

How we standardize our measurments. no system of units is better than any other system of units is better than any other system of units, but we **need to be consistent** in order to effectively communicate with each other.

|   Dimension   |   SI Unit |   English Unit    |

|---------------|-----------|-------------------|

|   [Length] = L    |   Meter   |   Feet    |
|   [Mass] = M      |   Kilogram    |   Pound   |
|   [Time] = T      |   Second  |   Second

### Metric System Prefixes to Units

### Converting Units

For a system, converting all physical quantities in one unit system is essential before proceding toward analyzing the system.

These unit conversions are done using a tool known as "Conversion Factor". For Example: 9.8 m/s^2 = 7.9 * 10 ** 4 mi/hr^2

##  Significant Figures



##  Dimensional Analysis

*   The dimensions on each side of an equation **must** match. If they don't, the equation is **wrong**.
*   To add or subract two quantities, they **must** have the same dimensions. (1.0s + 1.2m = ?!)
*   **Check** the dimensions of any formula you derive. This is the most basic way to find if you have made errors in your derivation
*   Answers to all problems must have units!
*   Unites can be treated like an Algebraic Variable (kg * kg = kg ** 2)

Example: [T] +- [T] = [T]
