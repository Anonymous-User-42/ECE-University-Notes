#   Types of Models in Physics

*   Geometric Models
*   Simplification Models
*   Analysis Models
*   Structural Models

##  Geometric Models

We set up a **geopetric construct** that represents the real-world situation, but which removes the complexity. We can then use this model to solve the problem.

Example:    Determine the Circumference of a Pizza (Not a perfect circle, But we assume that it is a perfect circle, averaging the radius)

##  Simplification Models

*   Simplification Models are very important in Physics.
*   Simplification Models remove details from the system that have no impact on the outcome of the problem.

Examples include:

*   Rigid Objects
*   Frictionless surfaces (or surfaces with constant friction)
*   Massless Springs
*   

### Rigid Bodies
