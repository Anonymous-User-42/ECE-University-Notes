{Before beginning this investigation we must know the methods and the theory behind the investigation and the due course of action.}

{In accordance with the Einstien's Theory of Light,}

	$$E_{light}  =e\Delta V_{stop} + \phi$$

	$$E_{photon} = hf = \frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
	
	$$\frac{hc}{\lambda} = e\Delta V_{stop} + \phi$$
	
	$$\Delta V_{stop} = \frac{hc}{e\lambda} - \frac{\phi}{e}$$
	
{Comparing the above equations with our standard linear line equation, $y = mx + b$, we have;}

	$$m = \frac{hc}{e}; c = \frac{-\phi}{e}$$
