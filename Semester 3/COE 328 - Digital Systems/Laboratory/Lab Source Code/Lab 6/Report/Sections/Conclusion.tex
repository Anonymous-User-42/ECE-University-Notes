{In summary, the thorough exploration and application of the General Processor Unit (GPU) in this laboratory have yielded favorable results across diverse problem sets. ALU-P1, ALU-P2, and ALU-P3, tailored for Problem Sets 1, 2, and 3, respectively, executed specified operations effectively.}

{ALU-P1, designed for the student with identification number 501209136, adeptly processed inputs A and B, producing precise outcomes aligned with prescribed functionalities. Likewise, ALU-P2, customized for Problem Set 2 with the same student identification number, demonstrated successful performance. ALU-P3, devised for Problem Set 3, continued this success using the student number 501209136.}

{The tangible success observed in the experiments is evidenced by in-lab photographs included in this report, substantiating the effective execution and contributing to the comprehensive documentation of the lab's outcomes.}

{In essence, the triumphant results of ALU-P1, ALU-P2, and ALU-P3 highlight expertise in VHDL design, FPGA board implementation, and control unit modifications. This reinforces our comprehension of processor unit components, showcasing the practical application of theoretical concepts in the design of digital systems.}
