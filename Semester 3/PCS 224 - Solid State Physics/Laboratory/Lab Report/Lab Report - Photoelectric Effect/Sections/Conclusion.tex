{There are many things that can be taken away from this experiment such as theory vs. practical and potential vs kinetic energy. With the experiment only taking place within 5 seconds, not much can interfere with the results. Calculations were done to find different values using the data observed. If the experiment was done with a larger time interval, the calculations could have been different. This is due to air resistance which would have made the oscillations slow down.}

{On the topic of theory, this experiment supports the theory that potential energy and kinetic energy are opposite to each other. When the graph was completed, the lines that represent each type of energy were always opposite to each other. This is because potential energy transforms into kinetic energy and vice versa.}
