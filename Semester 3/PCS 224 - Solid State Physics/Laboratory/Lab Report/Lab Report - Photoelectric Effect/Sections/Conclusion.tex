{After analysis of the experiment data and comparing the resulting Planck’s constant ($7.04\times10^{-34}Js$) to the accepted value of Planck’s constant ($6.63\times10^{-34}Js$), the percentage error was found to be 6\%.}

{The positioning of the light source, $\frac{hc}{e}$ requires absolute human precision and would not be completely accurate as the difference of even a millimeter would drastically impact the result by affecting the stopping potential.}

{Therefore, the experimental value could be said to be within acceptable limits due to the experimental error in the results is of a reasonable maginitude.}
