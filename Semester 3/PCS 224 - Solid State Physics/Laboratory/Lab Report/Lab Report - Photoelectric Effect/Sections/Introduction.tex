{The main objective of this lab is to study and examine the properties of photoelectric effect. This will be done by observing the volatges produced when beams of light from a spectrum of various wavelengths hit a metal plate.}

{The resulting graphs shall be analyzed by using the Excel software and by using Linear trend lines from the data set to analyze the approximate behaviour of the phenomenon producing a potential difference with respect to different wavelengths of light.}
