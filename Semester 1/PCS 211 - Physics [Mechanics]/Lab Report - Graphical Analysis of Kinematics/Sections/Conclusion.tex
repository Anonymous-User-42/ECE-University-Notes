{In this lab report, we have investigated and studied how one-dimensional motion changes with gradation in time using motion detectors and video analysis tools.}

{We had further analysed the uncertainties in measurement of the calculated acceleration by estimating and calculating the variation within the theoretical and actual values of acceleration. In this dure process we had come to a conclusion that the actual acceleration was not too accurate when compared to the theoretical values of acceleration. The physical calculation method presented us with great uncertainities that were not intially thought of.}

{We had finally come to some conclusion that : }

\begin{enumerate}
	\item {The accelerations are similar because the equation for acceleration is g sin theta stays constant}
	\item {The first experiment initiates the cart from 0 while the second experiment gradually reaches 0, leaving the acceleration to be very similar}
	\item {The force was used to push the cart up the ramp was inculed in the calculation (thus some uncertainity in measurement) is very similar to the gravitational force that was used to bring the cart down the ramp}
	\item {The predicted and calculated acceleration are not relatively consistent with each other}
\end{enumerate}
