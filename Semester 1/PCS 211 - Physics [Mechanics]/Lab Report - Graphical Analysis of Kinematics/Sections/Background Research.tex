{Before beginning this investigation we must know the methods and the theory behind the investigation and the due course of action.}

\section{{Velocity Measument}}

	{We shall be measuring the velocity of the Vernier Dynamics Cart by the use of Vernier Motion Sensor that measures instantaneous velocity by calculating minute changes in position from the reference observer. Mathematically,}

		$$\overrightarrow{v} = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow}\frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{x}}{\Delta t} = \frac{dx}{dt}$$

\section{{Acceleration Measurement}}

	{We shall be calculating the acceleration of the Vernier Dynamics Cart by the use of data sets of velocity that we obtain from the Vernier Sensors that measures instantaneous velocity.}
	
	{We shall aim to calculate the acceleration of the cart by considering the ratio of the difference of two velocities of the cart and the time interval between them. Mathematically,}	
	
		$$\overrightarrow{a} = \frac{\Delta \overrightarrow{v}}{\Delta t} = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{d^2x}{dt^2}$$
