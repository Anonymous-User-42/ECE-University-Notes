{Before beginning this investigation we must know the methods and the theory behind the investigation and the due course of action.}

\section{{Centripetal Force}}

	{Centripetal force refers to a force
that acts on an object that keeps it moving along a circular path. It is described mathematically as,}

		$$F_{c} = m\frac{v^2}{r}$$

	{Centripetal force is always perpendicular to the direction of the object's
displacement. Centripetal acceleration on the other hand refers to the motion of the object itself
that is traveling in a circular path. It is described mathematically as,}

		$$a_{c} = \frac{v^2}{r}$$

	{Alternatively, we may mathematically represent the centripetal force as,}

		$$F_{c} = \frac{4\pi^2mr}{T^2}$$
		
\section{{Acceleration}}

	{Acceleration is defined as a change in velocity, either in magnitude or direction . Because the direction of the velocity changes constantly in uniform circular motion, there is always an acceleration, even if the speed is constant.}
