#   Standards of Length, Mass, and Time

Standards in measurement must:

*   be readily accessible
*   possess some property that can be measured reliably
*   yield same result
*   not change with time

Meter:  distance traveled by light in vacuum during a time
interval of $\frac{1}{299 792 458}$ second.

Note: The speed of light in vacuum is **precisely** $299 792 458$ $\frac{m}{s}$.

Kilogram:   Mass of a specific platinum–iridium alloy
cylinder kept at the International Bureau of Weights and
Measures at Sèvres, France.

Second: $9 192 631 770$ times the period of vibration of
radiation from the **cesium-133** atom.

#   Units & Basic Quantities in Mechanics

In Mechanics, all physical quantities can be expressed in
terms of three basic quantities, **Length**, **Mass** and **Time**.

#   Units

*   No Plurals (e.g., m = 5 kg not kgs )
*   Separate Units with a • (e.g., meter second = m • s )
*   Exponential powers apply to units, e.g., cm • cm = cm2
*   Compound prefixes should not be used.

#   Common Prefixes

*   $10^9$  -   Giga (G)
*   $10^6$  -   Mega (M)
*   $10^3$  -   Kilo (k)

#   Scientific Notation

*   The multiplier of the power of 10 needs to be between 1 and 10

#   Dimensions in Mechanics

The dimensions of an arbitrary physical quantity A in
mechanics is given by [A] = $L^a$ $M^b$ $T^c$ where a, b and c can
be positive, negative or zero.

#   Dimensional Analysis

An equation in physics is only correct if the physical quantities
on the left side of the equation have the same dimensions as the
quantities on the right side.

#   Order of Magnitude

The order of magnitude is the power of 10 that applies to the data set.

#   Accuracy & Precision

*   A measure of how close an experimental result is to the true value is known as accuracy.
*   A measure of the degree of closeness of repeated measurements is known as precision.

#   Significant Figures

*   A significant figure is one that is reliably known.
*   In a measurement, the significant figures include
the first estimated digit.

##  Rules

*   The leading zeros are placeholders only.
*   The trailing zeros after the decimal place gives information
about the reliability of the measurement.

##  Operations with Significant Figures

When adding or subtracting, the number of decimal places in the
result should equal the smallest number of decimal places in any
term in the sum or difference.

Example:    $135 cm + 3.25 cm = 138 cm$

When multiplying or dividing several quantities, the number of
significant figures in the final answer is the same as the number
of significant figures in the quantity having the smallest number
of significant figures.

Example:    $15.3 m \times 2.5 m = 38 m$

#   Reading Uncertainities

For instruments having an incremented scale, by
common convention, we use half the value of the
smallest increment on our measuring instrument as
our estimate of the uncertainty.

For instruments with digital readouts, we often use plus or minus
the smallest digit as the uncertainty.

##  Random Uncertainity

*   Repeating the measurement may give slightly
varying results.

### Average (Mean) Value

$$\bar{x} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^{n}x_{i} = \frac{1}{n}\left(x_{1} + x_{2} + \cdots + x_{n}\right)$$

### Standard Deviation

$$\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i}^{n}{\left(x_{i} - \bar{x}\right)^2}}{\left(n - 1\right)}}$$

### Standard Deviation of the mean

$$\sigma_{m} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$$

##  Propagation of Uncertainity

### Addition & Subraction

For $(a \pm \Delta a) + (b \pm \Delta b) = (c \pm \Delta c)$ or $(a \pm \Delta a) - (b \pm \Delta b) = (c \pm \Delta c)$, is given by

$$\Delta c = \sqrt{\Delta a^2 + \Delta b^2}$$

Where $\Delta a$, $\Delta b$ and $\Delta c$ are the **Absolute Errors**.

### Multiplication & Division

For $(x \pm \Delta x)(y \pm \Delta y) = (z \pm \Delta z)$ or $\frac{(x \pm \Delta x)}{(y \pm \Delta y)} = (z \pm \Delta z)$, is given by

$$\frac{\Delta z}{z} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta x}{x}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{\Delta y}{y}\right)^2}$$

Where $\frac{\Delta z}{z}$, $\frac{\Delta x}{x}$ and $\frac{\Delta y}{y}$ are the **Percentage Errors**.

Note:   If a calculation is a mixture of operations, you propagate
uncertainties in the same order that you perform the calculations.
