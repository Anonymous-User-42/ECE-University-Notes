misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct

I've put in what seems to be necessary to fix
the current column of the current alignment.
Try to go on, since this might almost work.

I've inserted something that you may have forgotten.
(See the <inserted text> above.)
With luck, this will get me unwedged. But if you
really didn't forget anything, try typing `2' now; then
my insertion and my current dilemma will both disappear.
