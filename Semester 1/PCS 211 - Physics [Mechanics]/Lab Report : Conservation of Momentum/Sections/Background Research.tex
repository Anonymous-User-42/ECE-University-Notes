{Before beginning this investigation, we must know the methods and the theory behind the investigation and the due course of action.}

\section{{Momentum}}

	{Momentum is defined as the scalar product of mass and velocity. Mathematically,}

		$$p = mv$$

	{According to the principle of conservation of momentum, in a closed system, the net change in momentum is always zero. Mathematically,}

		$$\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\Delta p} = 0$$

	{Rewriting this expression mathematically we have,}

		$$\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{p_{i}} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{p_{f}}$$

	{Applying the above equation to our experiment we have,}

		$$m_{1}v_{i_{1}} + m_{2}v_{i_{2}} = m_{1}v_{f_{1}} + m_{2}v_{f_{2}}$$

	{In a special case where if we are to have a inelastic collision (same final velocity for both the masses), our expression would reduce to,}

		$$m_{1}v_{i_{1}} + m_{2}v_{i_{2}} = \left(m_{1} + m_{2}\right)v_{f}$$
		
\section{{Kinetic Energy}}

	{Kinetic Energy is defined mathematically as,}
	
		$$K = \frac{1}{2}mv^{2}$$
