\begin{enumerate}
	\item {Connect the motion detector software to the computerâ€™s hardware, ensure all electronics are switched on and in good working order}
	\item {Utilizing the lab jack and the protractor, angle the track at 15 degrees}
	\item {Adjust the motion detector and cart, so they will not be closer than 15cm from each other}
	\item {Using the Scale, measure the mass of all weights in experiment}
	\item {Ensure you have all necessary materials}
	\item {Measure and record the plate length on top of the glider}
	\item {Using the logger pro software, download and open the file from D2L. Replace the default object length with the recorded measured value of plate}
	\item {Set the two photogate timers to be 0.6 meters from each other}
	\item {Attach the mass to the cart with a string attached to the pulley}
	\item {Attach weights to the glider/cart and the hanger. The starting weight should be 30 grams}
	\item {Set the glider to a starting position}
	\item {Release the cart and press play on the logger pro screen simultaneously}
	{Record and store all the data shown on logger pro}
	\item {Repeat steps 8-10 twice for a total of three times}
	\item {Slowly decrease the masses on the cart to add it to the hanger. Repeat till there is no mass on the cart}
\end{enumerate}
