	{In order to calculate the experimental acceleration, we need to use the equations of motion. Namely,}

		$$a = \frac{v^{2}_{f} - v^{2}_{i}}{2d}$$

	{Where $v_{f}$ is the final velocity, $v_{i}$ is the initial velocity and $d$ is the distance between the two photogates.}

\section{{Sample Calculation}}

		$$a = \frac{v^{2}_{f} - v^{2}_{i}}{2d} = 0.394 m/s$$
