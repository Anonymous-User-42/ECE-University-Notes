{We shall in the due process of the laboratory experiment, aim to demonstrate the validity of Newton's second law, which asserts that an object's acceleration is directly proportional to the net force exerted on it.}

{We aim to validate Newton's 2nd law from this experiment by investigating the effects of the system's mass on the acceleration of the system and the effects of the applied force on the acceleration of a system. This was accomplished by analyzing the acceleration of a glider/cart drawn by a string in a pulley system attached to a hanger to where mass can be added.}
