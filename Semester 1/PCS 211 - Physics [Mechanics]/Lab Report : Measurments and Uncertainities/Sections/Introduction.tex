{We shall in the due process of the laboratory experiment, aim to calculate the density of some unknown given metal mass (metal block) through measuring mass and volume through various method.}

{We then shall use the information from the experiment to estimate the substance type of the metal block by comparing the densitiy of the given metal block to the densities of some known metals.}

{We shall futher aim to calculate the uncertainities in measurments of the mass and volume through subsequent different methods and find the most optimal method for the purposes of evaluating the densities of any substance.}
