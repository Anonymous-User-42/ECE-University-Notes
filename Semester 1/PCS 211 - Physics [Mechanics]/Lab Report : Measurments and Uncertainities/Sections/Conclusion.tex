{In this lab report, we have investigated an unknown given metal mass (rectangular block) and estimated the metal type by examining the densitiy of the metal block by various methods.}

{We had further analysed the uncertainties in measurement of the various different methods that were utilized in the above lab report. In this dure process we had come to a conclusion that the method of using a \textbf{vernier caliper} is the \textbf{best way of approach} as it presents us with least amount of uncertainities in measurement, implying a \textbf{higher level accuracy} in the density measurement.}

{We had finally come to a conclusion that the unknown mass presented upon us was made up of iron. We had come upon this conclusion by comparing the relative densities found in the due course of this investigation to a set of known metals and their densities}
