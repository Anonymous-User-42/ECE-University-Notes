\textit{The \textbf{safety measures} that were taken during the experimentation as as follows:}

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Proper Laboratory equipment was utilized to conduct and collect data}
		\item \textit{All Laboratory equipment was used in the presence of Lab \textbf{instructors} and Lab \textbf{personnel}}
		\item \textit{The experiment was performed at a distance from the observer so as to, limit or eliminate the chances of any possible physical harm to the observer}
		\item \textit{Any and all lab equipment was thoroughly examined for any defects that could potentially lead to safety hazards, before initiating experimentation}
		\item \textit{It was made sure the experiment shall not be performed close to highly flammable materials that would result in combustion from the frictional force onto the fluid medium}
	\end{itemize}
