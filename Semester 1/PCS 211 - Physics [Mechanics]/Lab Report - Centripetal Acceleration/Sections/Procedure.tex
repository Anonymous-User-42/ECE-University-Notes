\begin{enumerate}
	\item {Using the scale, measure and record the mass of the hanging mass with uncertainty.}
	\item {Attach the mass to the spring, loosen the screw that holds the cross arm and moves it to 14cm from the shaft.}
	\item {Adjust the pin to be located on top of the hanger mass.}
	\item {Using the vernier calipers, measure the distance between the center of the shaft and pin.}
	\item {Reattach the mass, the string should be tight. If not, readjust it, so it is.}
	\item {Practice Spinning the shaft at the right speed so it travels in a circular path}
	\item {Once mastered, the rate of spinning spin starts the stopwatch and times how long 20 revolutions take.}
	\item {Detach the spring and redo the experiment with three more radii.}
\end{enumerate}
