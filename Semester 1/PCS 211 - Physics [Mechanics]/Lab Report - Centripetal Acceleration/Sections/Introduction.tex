{The main objective of this lab is to study the circular motion of a hanging mass around a pulley.
This will be done by graphing the time the hanging mass took to make 20 revolutions vs the
mass value required to bring the hanging mass in equilibrium.}

{The values measured in this lab
will be the time it took for the mass to reach 20 revolutions (three trials for four different radii), the mass required to bring the hanging mass into equilibrium, and the force at equilibrium.}
