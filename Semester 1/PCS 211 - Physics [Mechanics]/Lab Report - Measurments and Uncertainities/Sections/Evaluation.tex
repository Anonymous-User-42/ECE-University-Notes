{If we are to compare our findings with the desities of known metals, we would come to the conclusion that, the \textbf{given metal block is made up of iron}.}

{$\therefore \text{percentage uncertanity in measurement by ruler} = \left(1 - \frac{\rho_{c2}}{\rho_{c1}}\right)\cdot 100 \approx 16 \%$}

{$\text{percentage uncertanity in measurement by archimedes principle} = \left(1 - \frac{\rho_{c3}}{\rho_{c1}}\right)\cdot 100 \approx 15 \%$}
